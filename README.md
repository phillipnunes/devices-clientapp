## :zap: Devices application

An application used to list, insert, update and delete devices, built with React, Hooks, TypeScript, SCSS, Jest/Enzyme and Material UI.

It's consuming a fake API from this repository: https://github.com/NinjaRMM/devicesTask_serverApp

There is an .env file in the root folder changing the default port, to not conflict with the API when running locally.
